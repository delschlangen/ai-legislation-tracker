## Data Currency Limitations

**Important:** This dataset is a point-in-time snapshot of AI legislation status. Please note:

1. **Legislation changes frequently.** Bills may be amended, enacted, vetoed, or rescinded between dataset updates.

2. **Verification dates vary.** Each entry includes a `last_verified` field indicating when that specific item was last checked against official sources.

3. **Not comprehensive.** This dataset tracks selected significant legislation and does not claim to include every AI-related law globally.

4. **Not legal advice.** Always verify current status with official government sources before making compliance or legal decisions.

When citing, we recommend including the access date:
